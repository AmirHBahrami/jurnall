#NOTE
Sending global events through State, consists of using it's notifyAll() inherited method to just tell all componenets about the event

#TODO
- protect password String in heap of jvm from being read/written unless the program gives the permisson - this needs more research
- write an EntryProvider class to read entries and save each entry's repository this might later be used to retrieve online shit

#NOTE 
exceptions are supposed to be caught IN CONTROLLERS , and then handled (that is, either let user know or log it)
